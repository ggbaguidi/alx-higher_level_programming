# alx-higher_level_programming

This repository is a collection of small, self-contained exercises used for ALX "Higher Level Programming" training.

Each `0xNN-.../` directory groups exercises by topic (Python, C, SQL, JavaScript). Files are intentionally minimal and are evaluated by exact output text; preserve formatting and function signatures when editing.

Quick start

Run a single Python exercise:

```bash
python3 0x00-python-hello_world/2-print.py
```

Compile and run a C exercise:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/13-insert_number.c -o insert_number
./insert_number
```

Conventions (important)

- Python scripts that are executable include a shebang using `/usr/bin/python3` on the first line.
- Keep printed output identical to the exercise expectation (spacing, punctuation, newlines).
- Do not add external dependencies or global tooling unless requested.
- Preserve function names and default parameter values — tests rely on them.

Structure

- `0x00-python-hello_world/` — beginner Python scripts (print examples).
- `0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/` — control flow and functions.
- `0x02-python-import_modules/` — module and import exercises.
- `0x03-python-data_structures/` — lists, tuples, dictionaries.
- `0x04-python-more_data_structures/` — advanced containers.
- `0x05-python-exceptions/` — exception handling.
- `0x06-python-classes/` — classes and objects.
- (other folders follow the same pattern: each is an independent exercise set)

If you plan to modify many files, open an issue or ask the repo owner before introducing cross-exercise refactors.
