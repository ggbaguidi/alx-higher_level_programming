0x00 - Python - Hello World

This folder contains the first, very small Python exercises (printing and basic output). Files are single-purpose and often executed directly. Preserve exact printed output when editing files.

How to run

```bash
python3 0x00-python-hello_world/2-print.py
```

Conventions

- Keep the shebang line if present (`/usr/bin/python3`).
- Use `print(..., end="")` only when the exercise explicitly requires no newline.
